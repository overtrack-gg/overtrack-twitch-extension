            Checking OverTrack client status...

            <p>
                Congratulations, it looks like you have the OverTrack client set up and linked to your Twitch account.
            </p>
            <p>
                Start streaming with the client running, and the overlay should work. Remember your game needs to be in 16:9 English.
            </p>
            <p>
                Your most recent game tracked (if any) will display below.
            </p>
            <img class="last-game" style="height: 80px; display: block;"/>
        </div>
        <div class="account-not-found" style="display: none;">
            <p>
                It appears you have not run the OverTrack client on an account linked to your twitch account.
            </p>
            <p>
                You can download the OverTrack client <a href="https://overtrack.gg/client">here</a>.
